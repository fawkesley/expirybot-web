I'm Paul and I'd like to introduce myself since you recently signed up to my PGP monitoring service, www.expirybot.com.

I'm trying to help people who struggle under oppressive surveillance and censorship. Expirybot is one small way I can make those people's lives easier.

In order to guide my work, it would be incredibly helpful if I could occasionally ask you for feedback by email. Is that OK?

If you're happy to receive very occasional emails from me, please click below:

If not, no problem, I haven't signed you up to anything.

Thanks,
Paul
